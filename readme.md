#PyBer

##Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze and graph data for a presentation I will be making with Omar, a colleague at my ride-sharing company, PyBer.  We looked at individual ride data as a whole, then broke it down by type of city the rides we taken in.  We looked at fares by type, drivers by type, and rides by type, as well as doing a final summary showing total fare over time, measured in weeks.

##Results
To me, the results are not surprising, but they are interesting none the less.

###Overall Analysis
Fig1 gives a very good overall look at the results.  It can be seen that the types of cities to have the most drivers are urban, followed by suburban, and then rural.  The urban also has the most total rides, as well as the lowest fare.  To me all of this indicates that rides in urban settings are shorter, and occur more frequently, which is expected since there are more people living in the urban areas as compared to the suburban or rural.  This is backed up by Fig2 and Fig3, which show the ride count per city based on type and the ride fare per city based on type.  It is shown in Fig2 that on average there is a much larger number of rides given in the urban setting than the rural setting.  However, the fares are much higher in the rural setting, as shown in Fig3.

###Type Analysis
Fig5, Fig6, and Fig7 illustrate the overall analysis in a slightly different way by looking at the percentages of overall data as opposed to the total numbers.  From Fig5, we can clearly see that almost 63% of all fares are taken in from the urban setting.  The urban setting is something that the company will want to continue to maintain as almost 2/3's of the revenues come from there.  Fig6 shows that we have even a higher percentage of rides hailed from an urban setting that the percent of the revenues.  It makes sense that the urban ride totals will take up more of the total fares since the average fare per ride in the urban setting is more.  What this shows though is that the urban setting is even more important as over 68% of all transactions occur in the urban setting.  Fig7 completes the comparisons by showing how many drivers are in each location based on percent.  Getting a number from Fig1 would have been impossible, but based on the size of each dot in the Fig1 scatter, you can tell that urban settings have many more drivers each, and there are many more urban cities that rural or suburban.  The number Fig7 got us was about 81% of the drivers operate in the urban setting.

###Grouped Analysis
Lastly, there is the PyBer_fare_summary that was created as the second deliverable.  It contained the total fares collected on any given week, from January 1st to April 28th.  It shows how the rural is always the lowest total fare in a week, and the urban is the highest revenue.  There are slight changes from week to week, and no noticeable pattern to predict if revenue will increase or decrease in the next week.

##Summary
The first recommendation I would give is that we should have more drivers in the rural and suburban setting.  There is a huge discrepancy between total rides and total drivers, in those settings compared to the urban setting.  Not only to fix the apparent shortage, but since the fares are higher here it may lead to more revenue.
Second, I would look in to ways to grow the rural ridership.  The range of rides in this setting is between 3 and 12.  Recommendation one would fall flat if there was not the demand for the drivers.
Lastly, I would dig deeper on which urban and suburban settings have a low driver count and see if those can be increased.  Fig1 shows that there are a few locations with a relatively low driver count compared to others in those demographics.
